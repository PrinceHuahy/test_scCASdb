# Facilitating single-cell chromatin accessibility research with a user-friendly database

## Data Availability
We have publicly presented scCASdb, a standardized, high-quality, and user-friendly database for studying single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene regulation across a wide range of species, organs, and cell types. Moreover, we standardized datasets in the h5ad formats, which efficiently manage large-scale single-cell data and can be seamlessly utilized with Python-based machine learning methods. The datasets can be accessed through the [scCASdb.xlsx](https://github.com/PrinceHuahy/test_scCASdb/scCASdb.xlsx) file in the repository.
